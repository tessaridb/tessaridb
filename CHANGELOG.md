# Changelog

Versions before 1.0 do not promise compatibility with each other. The query
language, the wire format and the on-disk format may each change in any release,
and **there is no migration between versions** — a store written by one version
is not guaranteed to open under the next. Treat every upgrade as a fresh store
until this file says otherwise.

The three numbers a pre-release carries are never reused by the release that
follows it: `0.0.1-alpha` is followed by `0.0.2` or higher, never by a bare
`0.0.1`. That is what lets a backup written by a pre-release be told apart from
one written by a final release, because the ordered version a node stores and
compares carries no pre-release suffix.

## 0.0.1-alpha — 2026-08-25

The first version with a number on it. Everything before this was `0.0.0`, which
is to say unversioned.

It is **an alpha in the ordinary sense**: it runs, it is tested, and it is not
finished. Use it for prototypes, evaluation and development. Do not put data you
cannot lose behind it.

### What is here

One transactional record store with several access models over the same
records — documents, tables, edges, key–value spaces, buckets of bytes,
full-text, vectors, time windows and geometry — in one language, under one
snapshot. Two backends: in memory, and on disk on a log-structured merge-tree
engine.

Four ways in: an embedded library, the `tessaridb` command line, HTTP with
WebSocket subscriptions, and a framed binary wire protocol whose specification
and conformance corpus are published separately.

Around them: snapshot-isolation transactions, change subscriptions, namespaces
and databases with users and grants, health and readiness endpoints, metrics,
graceful drain, and log-as-backup with replay-as-restore.

463 conformance cases define the language and run in the build.

### What is not here

Stated as plainly as the list above, because an alpha that is vague about its
absences is worse than one that is missing more.

- **The nearest few is over positions, and the spatial index is untuned.**
  `DEFINE INDEX … SPATIAL` is written, maintained and now **read**: seven of the
  eight predicates are served by covering the query shape with cells, reading the
  entries under and above them, and rejecting what the stored bounding boxes
  settle before the exact predicate runs. `geo::disjoint` is the complement of a
  region, has no sound box filter, and stays an exact scan by design.
  The same index answers `ORDER BY geo::distance(at, …) LIMIT k` by walking
  cells cheapest-first, keyed by a distance nothing inside the cell can beat —
  exact rather than approximate, and therefore asking nothing of the statement.
  What is absent: a distance to a shape larger than a position, which is why
  that read is over positions; a nearest-first read under a `WHERE`;
  and any *measured* choice of how finely a query is covered — the budget is a declared constant,
  and the candidate-to-result ratio the store now measures is what will move it.
  <!-- absent: distance-to-a-shape-larger-than-a-position -->
  <!-- absent: nearest-first-under-a-where -->
  <!-- absent: measured-covering-budget -->
- **No sharding, no replication, no cluster membership.** Peers can be declared
  and read back; nothing replicates between them. The language has words for
  these; the engine does not have the machinery.
  <!-- absent: sharding-replication-cluster-membership -->
- **Not published to crates.io.** Every crate carries `publish = false`. Build it
  from source.
  <!-- absent: published-to-crates-io -->
- **No migration between versions**, as above.
  <!-- absent: migration-between-versions -->

### Known rough edges

- Two tests in the suite have failed under heavy parallel load on a busy machine
  and pass reliably otherwise. Both causes were identified and addressed — a
  commit retry loop that re-raced with no backoff, and a test precondition that
  sampled a transient — but neither failure could be reproduced on demand, so
  neither fix is proven. If the build is flaky for you, that is a real report and
  worth sending.

### Notes for anyone who tried an earlier commit

- `tessaridb --version` exists, and prints the full version including the
  pre-release suffix.
- `tessaridb --help` now prints to **standard output** and exits **zero**. It
  previously printed to standard error and exited non-zero, which meant
  `tessaridb --help | grep serve` came back empty. A misspelled flag is still a
  refusal on standard error with a non-zero status.
- `INFO FOR NODE` and `$node` carry a **`build`** field beside `version`.
  `version` is the ordered three numbers a node stores and an upgrade compares;
  `build` is the exact string this binary was compiled as.
- Building now documents its prerequisites: a C++ toolchain and `libclang`, both
  needed by the on-disk backend.
